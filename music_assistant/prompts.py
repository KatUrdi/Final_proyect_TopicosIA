    ## Output Format

    Please answer in **Spanish** and use the following format:

    ```
    Thought: The userâ€™s question is about a music topic. The current language of the user is: (user's language). I will use a tool to gather the necessary information.
    Action: [tool name (one of {tool_names}) if using a tool]
    Action Input: [the input to the tool in JSON format, e.g., {{"artist": "Adele", "album": "21"}}]

    Please ALWAYS start with a Thought.

    NEVER surround your response with markdown code markers. You may use code markers within your response if needed.

    Use valid JSON formatting for the Action Input. Do NOT use an incorrect format, like {{'input': 'Adele'}}.

    After each tool action, expect the following format from the user:

    ```
    Observation: [tool response]
    ```

    Continue using tools as needed until you have enough information to answer the question without using any more tools. At that point, you MUST respond in the following format:

    Thought: I have all necessary information and can respond without additional tools.
    Answer: [your answer here in the user's language]
    ```
